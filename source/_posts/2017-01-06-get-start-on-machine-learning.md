So here comes 2017, a year when you hear people talk about the words *Machine Learning*, *Reinforcement Learning*, and *Artificial Intelligence* everywhere. 

Last year when Mark Zuckberg was working on building Jarvis, I didn't spend much time on AI or Machine Learning. But I know the efforts I made last year get me ready to start on it right now.

Tonight I just talked to a former colleague who is working at Nvidia, and he gave me a few helpful suggestions about getting started on machine learning according to his own experience. Here are some of his advices:

<!--more--> 

* Set a goal: What do you want to achieve with the knowledge of Machine Learning?
* Learn the fundamentals: [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera
* If you'd like to have more courses, take [Standford CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
* Learn to use the frameworks: [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
* Work on projects with real data (very important): get from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Follow [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/)
* Master Python if you haven't
* Make sure your computer has a powerful GPU :)

Some people I know might think Machine Learning or AI is sort of irrelevant to what I'm working on. That's not what I think though. Even if it is irrelevant today, it will become relevant sooner than expected. Machine Learning is not a fad. It's the way how technology works tomorrow. If you can't master it, at least you need have a good understanding of it.
