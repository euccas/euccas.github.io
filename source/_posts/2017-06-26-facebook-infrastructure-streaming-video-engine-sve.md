description: Inside Facebook's Media Infrastructure: the design of Streaming Video Engine
---

In last year's Facebook F8 conference, Sachin Kulkarni, who worked on Facebook's Video Infrastructure, gave a talk to introduce the design of Facebook's Streaming Video Engine System (SVE). I found this talk particularly interesting because it revealed, in a very well structured, concise yet informative way, how Facebook infrastructure team came up with a solution to solve user difficulties by reviewing the end-to-end process, and how such a design meet the goal of being **fast**, **flexible**, **scalable**, and **efficient**. After watching the presentation video for a few times, I thought it would be helpful to write down some notes here, for my own reviewing in the future, and for people who might be interested in Facebook's media infrastructure.
