    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently at work, I have been working on developing a few features on top of <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>. Some of the features are UI heavy, and require some amount of the data visualization using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. While working on those features, I thought it could be a good chance to spend some time on learning D3.js in-depth, so I chose to read this book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/d3js-in-action-second-edition"><strong>D3.js in Action</strong></a> on manning.com. Here comes a summary of this book, and some notes I took while reading.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post_images/2021/20210425-d3js-book.png" width="360"></p>

<p>Overall I find this book is easy to read as long as you have some knowledge in JavaScript.  In this book, a few key concepts in D3.js are clearly laid out,  and the examples cover a good set of common usages and tactics you need to know for building data visualization features using D3.js.</p>

<p>This book has 11 chapters. Chapter 1, 2 and 3 are introduction to D3.js, the high level flow and common operations of using D3.js for information visualization, and how to structure a data visualization project with D3.js.</p>

<p>In the first three chapters, alongside with the basic concepts, a few tactics I find worth learning from the very beginning are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integrate scales in data binding</strong>: D3.js provides handy scale functions to normalize data values for better display. Example built-in scale functions include: <code>d3.scaleLinear()</code>, <code>d3.scaleSequential()</code>, <code>d3.scaleQuantize()</code> and so on. A D3 scale has two primary functions: .<code>.domain()</code> and <code>.range()</code>, both of which expect arrays and must have arrays of the same length to get the right results. The array in <code>.domain()</code> indicates the series of values being mapped to <code>.range()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enter, update, merge, and exit to update DOM elements</strong>: Understanding how to create, change, and move elements using <code>enter()</code>, <code>exit()</code>, and selections is the basis for all the complex D3 functionality. One note here is D3 doesn’t follow the convention that when the data changes, the corresponding display is updated; you need to build that functionality yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Getting access to the actual DOM element</strong> in the selection can be accomplished in one of two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using <code>this</code> in the inline functions (cannot be used with arrow functions)</li>
      <li>Using the <code>.node()</code> function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>this</code></p>

<p><code>
d3.select("circle").each(function(d,i) {
    console.log(d);console.log(i);console.log(this);
})
</code></p>

<p>Using <code>.node()</code> function</p>

<p><code>
d3.select("circle").node();
</code></p>

<p>Chapter 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 introduce the methods and details of building specific types of visualization for specific types of data: chart components, layouts, complex hierarchical data visualization,  network visualization, and visualizing geospatial information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One note about <strong>Layouts</strong>: D3 contains a variety of functions, referred to as layouts, that help you format your data so that it can be presented using a popular charting method. D3 layouts don’t result in charts; they result in the settings necessary for charts. Example D3 built-in layouts: <code>d3.layout.histogram()</code>, <code>d3.layout.pie()</code>, <code>d3.layout.tree()</code> etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter 9 covers how to using D3 with React. The challenge of integrating D3 with React is that React and D3 both want to control the DOM. The entire select/enter/exit/update pattern with D3 is in direct conflict with React and its virtual DOM. The way most people use D3 with React is to use React to build the structure of the application, and to render traditional HTML elements, and then when it comes to the data visualization section, they pass a DOM container (typically an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>) over to D3 and use D3 to create and destroy and update elements.</p>

<p>Chapter 10 and 11 are advanced usages about customizing layouts and components, and mixed mode rendering in HTML canvas.</p>

    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20180513/read-designing-distributed-systems.html"/>
    <updated>2018-05-13T18:22:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20180513/read-designing-distributed-systems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I read a book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920072768.do">Designing Distributed Systems</a>, which is written by <a href="https://twitter.com/brendandburns">Brendan Burns</a>, and published by O’Reilly earlier this year. This book introduces the patterns and components used in the development of distributed systems.</p>

<p>Before I started to read this book, I had three questions in my mind, and try to find the answers from the book. Those three questions are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What’s the most important difference between designing distributed systems and single machine systems?</li>
  <li>Why container technology, such as docker, kubernates, is so popular? How could it be helpful?</li>
  <li>What are the common patterns used in distributed systems design, and when shall I use them?</li>
</ol>

<p>This book does give me the answers, at least partial ones. I put my reading notes into a Google Slides, and  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1srX9hRS9tbtrEx7T1abxbHiD1gASkvllf1_W2SjuadA/edit?usp=sharing">you can find it here to read the details</a>. A PDF version in light background color is <a href="https://github.com/euccas/euccas.github.io/blob/source/data/read-2018-design_distributed_systems_lightver.pdf">available here</a>.</p>

<p>The short answers to my questions are as in the following:</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="whats-the-most-important-difference-between-designing-distributed-systems-and-single-machine-systems">What’s the most important difference between designing distributed systems and single machine systems?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Designing distributed systems can be significantly more complicated to design, build, and debug correctly.</li>
  <li>Designing distributed systems need much more efforts in designing for scalability and reliability.</li>
  <li>In a distributed system, tasks/data are spreaded to multiple workers. It requires techniques like containers and load balancing to utilize parallelisation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-container-technology-docker-kubernetes-is-so-popular-how-could-they-be-helpful">Why container technology (docker, kubernetes) is so popular? How could they be helpful?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Containers are not only useful for applications which have components running on multiple machines, but also for single machine applications.</li>
  <li>The goal of containerization is to <strong>establish boundaries</strong> around specific resources, team ownership, separation of concerns.</li>
  <li>The benefits include <strong>resource isolation</strong>, <strong>scaling teams</strong>, <strong>reuse components and modules</strong>, <strong>break big problems</strong> into smaller ones (Small, focused applications are easier to understand, be tested, updated and deployed)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-common-patterns-used-in-distributed-systems-design-and-when-shall-i-use-them">What are the common patterns used in distributed systems design, and when shall I use them?</h2>

<p>The book describes three types of patterns.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single node</strong> patterns: sidecar, ambassadors, adapters</li>
  <li><strong>Serving</strong> patterns: sharded services, scatter/gather, FaaS, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Batch computational</strong> patterns: Work queue, Event-driven batch processing, coordinated batch processsing, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more detailed description of each design pattern in my reading notes.</p>
